## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling  
- **Angular** for project structure  

### What I learned

This was my first challenge using **Tailwind with Angular**. I learned how to:  

- Configure Google Fonts (`Outfit`) in Tailwind using `@theme`.  
- Apply Tailwind utilities like `max-w-sm`, `rounded-3xl`, `object-cover` to replicate a design.  
- Adapt fixed-width designs (375px mobile, 1440px desktop) into a **responsive component**.
